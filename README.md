# Code-quiz

I created a quiz about Grey's Anatomy! There are 4 questions with a timer. 

When you click the start button the timer starts and it takes 1 second to give the answer of correct or incorrect. You will have 1 minute to finish the 4 questions. If you click the wrong answer the timer will deduct 10 seconds. 

The objective is to get the highscore and by doing so getting all the questions right.
